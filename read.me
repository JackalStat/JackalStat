- 👋 Hi, I’m @JackalStat.
- 👀 I’m a retired statistician with 30 years experience in what is now called data science and big data.  Although I am American and worked mainly in the USA, I now live outside the States.
- 🌱 I’m currently using R and the tidyverse for analysis and data management, although I have decades of experience in SAS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on public interest projects such as those by icij.org and ProPublica.  For the right project, I can work anonymously and without compensation.
- 📫 I can be reached at ufmqeohj1fcq@opayq.net
